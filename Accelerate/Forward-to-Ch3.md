Where do you see us as a software organization?

* Low Performers
* Medium Performers
* High Performers
* Elite Performers

What key factors, from the reading, would put us in that rating?

What do we need to change to move towards being an elite performing software organization?

Do you think this is achievable here?

How would becoming an Elite Performing Software organization help our customers?

Do the patients really “need” our software?

Why or why not?

## Forward

“effective IT delivery organizations take about an hour to get code from “committed to mainline” to “running in production,” a journey lesser organizations take months to do.” - Forsgren PhD, Nicole. Accelerate (p. 13). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.

How could we start moving towards that goal at DaVita?
Is it even possible?
What good/bad could come of such a practice?
Why would it work elsewhere and not at our organiztion?
(Devil’s advocate if this is the consensus)

What if we could “fix an issue or failure” that’s deployed to production within an hour? How would this benefit our customers?

The book suggests that change will need support from the “top”, but it shouldn’t be mandated from the top. It should come from within. Do you agree with this?

What’s it mean to not “boil the ocean”? Does it feel like we are trying to “boil the ocean” with all the changes lately? If so, what teams should start these changes? Do we need to limit the immediate scope?

## Preface

improvements in software delivery are possible for every team and in every company, as long as leadership provides consistent support—

Forsgren PhD, Nicole. Accelerate (p. 24). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.

Does leadership consistently support the changes we are trying to make?

### Part One

A recent Gartner study found that 47% of CEOs face pressure from their board to digitally transform (Panetta 2017).

Forsgren PhD, Nicole. Accelerate (pp. 37-38). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.

DaVita leadership is touting that we are working to “digitally transform”. Are we? Do you think our clinics, overall are seeing this transformation?

31% of the industry is not using practices and principles that are widely considered to be necessary for accelerating technology transformations, such as continuous integration and continuous delivery, Lean practices, and a collaborative culture

Forsgren PhD, Nicole. Accelerate (p. 37). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.

Are we a part of the 69% that are? Or the 31%?
Think about where we could improve today?


executives are especially prone to overestimating their progress when compared to those who are actually doing the work.

Forsgren PhD, Nicole. Accelerate (p. 38). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.

Are our executives overestimating our progress? How could that perception be impacting the clinics?


The key to successful change is measuring and understanding the right things with a focus on capabilities—not on maturity.

Forsgren PhD, Nicole. Accelerate (p. 39). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.

Do we focus on the right types of measurement within DaVita IT? Within DevOps specifically?
What else should we be measuring? How?


technology transformations should follow a continuous improvement paradigm.

Forsgren PhD, Nicole. Accelerate (p. 39). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.

Continuous Improvement is one of our core values (and probably my favorite core value). We talk about it all the time. Give examples of how we are following this paradigm in IT? What more can we do to directly support and effect our clinics?

always striving to be better and never consider themselves “mature” or “done” with their improvement or transformation journey—

Forsgren PhD, Nicole. Accelerate (p. 39). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.

At what point will we be “done” with our transformation journey?


organizations try to design their own assessment models, choose solutions that align with the skill sets of internal champions, or succumb to analysis paralysis because of the sheer number of areas that need improvement in their organization.

Forsgren PhD, Nicole. Accelerate (p. 41). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.

How can we narrow our focus and ensure we are focusing on the right areas? Back to “boiling an ocean”, we can’t, how can we focus to ensure our success and support our clinics sooner rather than later? Where should we start to focus?


high performers have: 46 times more frequent code deployments 440 times faster lead time from commit to deploy 170 times faster mean time to recover from downtime 5 times lower change failure rate (1/5 as likely for a change to fail)

Forsgren PhD, Nicole. Accelerate (p. 43). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.

Thoughts?



## Measuring Software Delivery Performance


A successful measure of performance should have two key characteristics. First, it should focus on a global outcome to ensure teams aren’t pitted against each other.

Second, our measure should focus on outcomes not output: it shouldn’t reward people for putting in large amounts of busywork that doesn’t actually help achieve organizational goals.

Forsgren PhD, Nicole. Accelerate (p. 48). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.

However, in modem software products and services, which are rapidly changing complex systems, failure is inevitable, so the key question becomes: How quickly can service be restored?

Forsgren PhD, Nicole. Accelerate (p. 52). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.

Is failure inevitable? How quickly are we currently able to recover? Assuming failure is inevitable, how can we minimize the impact of these on the clinics?


continuous improvement is both exciting and real, pushing companies to be their best, and leaving behind those who do not improve

Forsgren PhD, Nicole. Accelerate (pp. 55-56). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.

It’s one of our core values. How are we living this value in our movements to the cloud? In what way are the clinics realizing these improvements?


organizations, the ability to work and deliver in small batches is especially important, because it allows you to gather user feedback quickly using techniques such as A/B testing.

Forsgren PhD, Nicole. Accelerate (p. 63). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.

How could we, as an organization, start deploying in smaller batches? What impacts could you imagine this having on our current software delivery?


“Do change management boards actually improve delivery performance?” (Spoiler alert: they do not; they are negatively correlated with tempo and stability.)

Forsgren PhD, Nicole. Accelerate (p. 65). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.

We spend a lot of time on our CAB calls each week. What would be the impact of changing this process?


Organizational Cultures:

* Pathological - Power Oriented
* Bureaucratic - Rule Oriented
* Generative - Performance Oriented

Where do we fall and why? In what way is our current culture conducive to the way we want to do business, to achieve our goals?


Software Delivery Perfomance: Analysis showed that only lead time, release frequency, and time to restore together form a valid and reliable construct.

Forsgren PhD, Nicole. Accelerate (p. 77). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.

Agree/Disagree? What are your thoughts about these metrics?


“who is on a team matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work, and view their contributions” (Google 2015). In other words, it all comes down to team dynamics.

Forsgren PhD, Nicole. Accelerate (p. 78). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.

In what ways do you agree or disagree with this statement?


## How do we change culture?

Shook wrote, “what my . . . experience taught me that was so powerful was that the way to change culture is not to first change how people think, but instead to start by changing how people behave—what they do” (Shook 2010).

Forsgren PhD, Nicole. Accelerate (p. 79). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.

Let’s hear some ideas, considering what you’ve read in these chapters, what behaviors can we start to change? How will these changes roll up to the clinics?
